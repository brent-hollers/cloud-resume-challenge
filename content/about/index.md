I am a Technical Program Manager and Cloud Architect with over 5 years of experience driving infrastructure modernization and enterprise-grade cloud transformations. My background is rooted in the practical application of cloud technologies; I hold an **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate** certification and a **Postgraduate Certificate in Cloud Architecture** from the University of Texas at Austin.

Currently serving as a Director of Information Technology, I specialize in navigating the complex lifecycle of cloud migration. I successfully led a full-scale network overhaul that included migrating on-premise servers and domain services to **Azure Active Directory**, significantly improving security and scalability for hundreds of users. Beyond infrastructure, I design and deploy specialized cloud solutions, such as **AWS containerized environments** for practical programming applications and cyber ranges for technical training.

My technical foundation is strengthened by a **Master of Science in Data Science**, giving me a unique ability to leverage data analytics, Python, and SQL to inform strategic decision-making. Whether securing over $100k in funding for technical initiatives or serving as the primary liaison between technical teams and executive boards, I excel at translating complex technical requirements into actionable business value.
