      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is the third article, designed to cut through the jargon with the specific analogies I use when mentoring students for the SAA-C03.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-aws-architects-gotcha-list-two-concepts-that-trip-everyone-up&#34;&gt;The AWS Architect’s &amp;ldquo;Gotcha&amp;rdquo; List: Two Concepts That Trip Everyone Up&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I sat for the Solutions Architect exam, I breezed through the questions on EC2 and RDS. But there were two specific areas where I found myself staring at the screen, second-guessing my answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALB vs. NLB:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Both balance load, so why does it matter?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPC Endpoints:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Why are there two types, and why is one free?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are the &amp;ldquo;silent killers&amp;rdquo; of the exam. They seem similar on the surface, but confusing them ensures a fail on scenario-based questions. Here is the simplest way to visualize them so you never mix them up again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Technical Program Manager and Cloud Architect with over 5 years of experience driving infrastructure modernization and enterprise-grade cloud transformations. My background is rooted in the practical application of cloud technologies; I hold an &lt;strong&gt;AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate&lt;/strong&gt; certification and a &lt;strong&gt;Postgraduate Certificate in Cloud Architecture&lt;/strong&gt; from the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently serving as a Director of Information Technology, I specialize in navigating the complex lifecycle of cloud migration. I successfully led a full-scale network overhaul that included migrating on-premise servers and domain services to &lt;strong&gt;Azure Active Directory&lt;/strong&gt;, significantly improving security and scalability for hundreds of users. Beyond infrastructure, I design and deploy specialized cloud solutions, such as &lt;strong&gt;AWS containerized environments&lt;/strong&gt; for practical programming applications and cyber ranges for technical training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From On-Prem to Cloud-Native: A Federal Migration &amp; Modernization Journey </title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;objective&#34;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To develop a more concrete understanding of modernization and migration strategies for complex systems which also has specific security, resiliency, and accessibility requirements, I chose to simulate a realistic Federal Cloud Transformation scenario—migrating a legacy, stateful mission application from an on-premise data center to AWS, and subsequently refactoring it into a secure, scalable, cloud-native architecture on Kubernetes.&#xA;The Scenario:&#xA;A federal agency is running a critical &amp;ldquo;Mission Status&amp;rdquo; application on aging on-premise hardware (Dell PowerEdge/VMware). The agency has a mandate to evacuate the data center (Cloud First Policy) and improve the application&amp;rsquo;s security posture and scalability (Modernization).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What I learned when preparing for the Cloud Solutions Architect Exam</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a draft of the follow-up article, shifted to a first-person perspective to incorporate your personal experiences with the specific programs and mentors you mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;leveling-up-my-journey-to-the-aws-solutions-architect-associate&#34;&gt;Leveling Up: My Journey to the AWS Solutions Architect Associate&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam is the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; of the cloud, the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03) is emphatically the &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;why.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently passed the Solutions Architect exam, and I want to be transparent: this is a different beast entirely. It requires a significantly higher investment of prep time and mental energy. While the foundational exam tests your vocabulary, this exam tests your intuition and your ability to architect complex systems under specific constraints.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cloud Certification Prep: AWS Cloud Practitioner</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a draft of the article tailored to your specifications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-crush-the-aws-cloud-practitioner-exam-a-strategic-approach&#34;&gt;How to Crush the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam: A Strategic Approach&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) is the starting line for many cloud journeys. Before diving into the technical weeds, it is important to understand what this exam actually is. It is a &lt;strong&gt;foundational&lt;/strong&gt; exam, meaning it is not designed to test your ability to debug complex code or configure intricate firewall rules. Instead, it tests your understanding of high-level principles, the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of the AWS ecosystem, and the core concepts that drive cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is the third article in your series, written from the perspective of a seasoned data professional.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-one-tool-you-cant-avoid-why-sql-is-your-ticket-to-it-literacy&#34;&gt;The One Tool You Can’t Avoid: Why SQL is Your Ticket to IT Literacy&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my previous articles, I covered the cloud giants (AWS) and how to architect systems within them. But there is a fundamental layer that sits underneath almost every sophisticated application, reporting dashboard, and business decision in the world: &lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
